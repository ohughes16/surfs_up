# Surf's Up!

## Overview

W. Avy has requested an analysis to be done on the weather in Hawaii where they're looking to put a surf shop that also serves ice cream.  A key concern is how the store will do year round based on weather on that part of the island.  Will the weather allow this to be a sustainable business? 

## Results

To analyze the weather for this part of the island, I ran summary statistics on the month of June when the weather should be the nicest and the month of December which is when presumably the weather would be the worst for a surf / ice cream shop. We compiled all of the years for the months of June and December.

Our results on temperature are as follows:

June Temperatures

- Mean Temp: 74.9 with a St. Dev of 3.257 degrees
- Min Temp: 64
- Max Temp: 85
- 25%: 73
- 50%: 75
- 75%: 77

December Temperatures

- Mean Temp: 71.0 with a St. Dev of 3.746 degrees
- Min Temp: 56
- Max Temp: 83
- 25%: 69
- 50%: 71
- 75%: 83

Some major things that stand out to me in this analysis is that it is almost 4 degrees warmer in June, on average, than it is in December.  The minimum and maximum range of temperatures in June is smaller than the range of temperatures in December. One unique thing that stands out to me is that the 75th percentile for tempertures in December is higher than it is in June at 83 degrees.

## Summary

Additional queries should be done to be sure that this is a good opportunity for this surf shop.  I would look at the season trend for every month to really determine if December is the anticipated worst month for business due to weather. What is the weather in January like? If weather conditions were particularly bad in a year, how many months fall into the "rainy" season in Hawaii. These are all good metrics to analyze further.  Due to this being both a surf shop and an ice cream shop, what are the waves like in this location in June and December? Hawaii is known for having great surf in the winter, but will the surf shop still get business in the summer? Doing an analysis on wind and surf could really compliment the analysis that we have already preformed.
